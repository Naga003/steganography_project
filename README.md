# SECURE DATA HIDING IN IMAGES USING STEGANOGRAPHY

This project demonstrates a simple method for hiding and retrieving secret messages within images using steganography techniques. The code is written in Python and utilizes the OpenCV library for image processing.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- `os` module (part of the standard Python library)

## Installation

You can install OpenCV using pip if you don't have it already:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
